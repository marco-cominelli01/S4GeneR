Description: Provides a comprehensive set of S4 classes and respective constructor functions for
	representing the classification of genes. The first class is the 'Gene' virtual class, 
	from which the 'CodingGene' and 'NonCodingGene' classes are derived. The 'NonCodingGene' 
	class is a virtual class from which 'HousekeepingNonCodingGene' and 'RegulatoryNonCodingGene'
	virtual classes are derived. From 'HousekeepingNonCodingGene' class, 'tRNAGene' and 'rRNAGene' 
	classes are derived, while from 'RegulatoryNonCodingGene' class 'SmallNonCodingGene' and
	'LongNonCodingGene' classes are derived. From the virtual class 'SmallNonCodingGene', 'miRNAGene',
	'siRNAGene', 'piRNAGene', 'snRNAGene' and 'snoRNAGene' classes are derived. The package also provides
	methods to access and modify all attributes of these objects. Finally, additional functions are provided to
	compute the gene product length and to plot the gene (and corresponding transcript if defined).
